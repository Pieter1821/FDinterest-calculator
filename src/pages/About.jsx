      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Fixed deposits are a popular investment option in South Africa, offering a guaranteed return on your investment.

      <h2>What are fixed deposits?</h2>
      <p>
        A fixed deposit is a type of investment where you deposit a sum of money with a bank for a fixed period of time,
        usually ranging from 1 month to 5 years. In return, the bank pays you a fixed interest rate on your investment.
        The interest rate is usually higher than what you would earn on a regular savings account, and the return is
        guaranteed.
      </p>

      <h2>How do fixed deposits work?</h2>
      <p>
        To open a fixed deposit account, you need to have a minimum amount of money to invest, which varies from bank to
        bank. The interest rate you earn on your investment depends on the amount of money you invest and the length of
        the investment period. The longer the investment period, the higher the interest rate you will earn.
